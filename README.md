# Personal Pomodoro Timer 🍅

A minimalist productivity tool built with React to help maintain focus and manage work sessions effectively. This project was created to explore React's latest features while solving a personal need for a clean, customizable timer.

## Why Another Pomodoro Timer? 🤔

I wanted to build a distraction-free Pomodoro timer that:

- Remembers my preferred settings
- Doesn't require an account
- Works offline
- Has a clean, minimalist UI

## Getting Started 🚀

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigat to project dir
git clone https://github.com/eronmiranda/react-pomodoro-timer.git && cd react-pomodoro-timer

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start dev server
bun run dev
```

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **React** - for building the UI
- **JoyUI** - for consistent component look and design
- **Vite** - For lightning-fast development
- **LocalStorage** - for persistence without a backend

src/
├── components/       # reusable UI components
